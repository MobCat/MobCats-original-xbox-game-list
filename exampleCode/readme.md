# Code examples 

This folder / workspace contains a bunch of example and demo code for working with MobCat's Title ID Database.<br>
One of the goals of the database was to make it easy to integrate into and use with other apps, and the best way to show that off is to have some examples you can just copy, paste, and use right away.<br><br>

Samples contain demos of using the API directly, parts of the website as a pseudo API and the sqlite database directly, however some projects may not have sample code for all of these functions yet.<br>
This does not mean you can't use that function with your code base, just nobody has made and submitted any sample code yet for that code base or application.
