# This example will download MobCat's Title ID cover scan thumbnail image set
# and then convert and rename them in accordance to the libretro schema as kinda detailed here
# http://thumbnailpacks.libretro.com/Microsoft%20-%20Xbox/Named_Boxarts/resize.sh
# Full image set can be viewed from this folder
# http://thumbnailpacks.libretro.com/Microsoft%20-%20Xbox/Named_Boxarts/
# I wanted to actually download this image set, clean it up, and then add to it from MobCat's
# image set, however, after blacklisting over 70% of this image set to be cleaned and fixed
# I figured it would be better for a simple example script, that we just build a new set from scratch
# rather then trying to fix and cludge an existing set.
