# MobCat's original xbox game ID list

A.K.A Game Title ID

Just trying to expand on the lists that are already out there WITH EVEN MORE DATA  
If this list is missing useful data let me know and we'll see if we can add it.  
Please note, most of this info is extracted from the games "default.xbe"  
Games that use multiple xbes like morrowind, Unreal II, a lot of compellation disks like Midway Arcade Treasures 3  
or any game that has a Title Update, so that is actually what's booting not the default xbe may produce different metadata.  
Because of this I'm not documenting anything that's not a "default.xbe" for now, It will just devolve into madness quickly.  
Like if I where also to dump and log all the save game icons, not just the title icons.  
I do need to log TUs at some point, but just logging all the main games is going to be enough work.

# Lists in this repo

**ListKey.md** is well, the key for the table. It explains what the categories in the list are.

**GameList.md** is the nice list, with icons and stuff.  
You can also find an alt copy of this list at [https://rentry.org/wpqaz](https://rentry.org/wpqaz)  
And you can find all the icons in the icon folder in this GitHub.

**GameList.csv** is the same as the markdown list, but no game icons. Just data.  
It can be searched and easily viewed with GitHubs table viewer thing.  
Please note, some characters like " had to be removed from the title names to keep GitHub happy.

**GameList.txt** is a raw text dump from my "tools".  
Might be useful if for some reason you can't ingest the csv into your project.
