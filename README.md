# MobCat's original xbox game ID list
A.K.A Game Title ID

Just trying to expand on the lists that are already out there WITH EVEN MORE DATA
If this list is missing useful data let me know and we'll see if we can add it.

ListKey.md is well, the key for the table. It explains what the categories in the list are.

GameList.md is the nice list, with icons and stuff.
You can also find an alt copy of this list at [https://rentry.org/wpqaz](https://rentry.org/wpqaz)
And you can find all the icons in the icon folder in this GitHub.

GameList.csv is the same as the markdown list, but no game icons. Just data.
It can be searched and easily viewed with GitHubs table viewer thing.

GameList.txt is a raw text dump from my "tools".
Might be useful if for some reason you can't ingest the csv into your project.
